	<h2 class="loraItalic16pt8CA671">Cookies</h2>
	<p class="arial16ptEFE7D3">
		Cookies are small data files that a web Application you visit may save on your hard drive that
		usually includes an anonymous unique identifier. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from
		your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. The Hostess web
		Application uses cookies for user authentication, keeping track of your preferences, promotional
		campaigns that require user identification, keeping track of our audience size and traffic patterns,
		and in certain other cases.
		<br />
		<br />
		You can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is
		being used. However, if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to
		use Hostess products or services that require you to sign in or take advantage of all the features
		of Hostess.
		<br />
		<br />
		Hostess may allow third party business partners that display advertisements on some of our web
		pages to maintain their own cookies on your computer. These business partners do not have
		access to Hostess&#146;s cookies and their use is subject to their own privacy policies.
	</p>
	<h2 class="loraItalic16pt8CA671">Links</h2>
	<p class="arial16ptEFE7D3">
		The Hostess web Application and services may contain links to other Applications and
		advertisements. Hostess is not responsible for the privacy policy or other practices employed by
		websites linked to, or from, our web Application nor the information or content contained
		therein. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web Application.

	<h2 class="loraItalic16pt8CA671">Data Security</h2>
	<p class="arial16ptEFE7D3">
		Hostess takes the security of your data seriously. In order to protect your information, we have
		implemented various security measures. For example, anytime you transmit to and from Hostess
		over the internet, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
		Hostess also follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
		submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
		<br />
		<br />
		Hostess is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable
		precautions to protect it. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless,
		cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure and as a result we cannot ensure the security of
		information you transmit to us; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.
		Once we receive your data transmission, we make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
		its security on our systems.
		<br />
		<br />
		Your personal information and data stored in our systems is protected by various physical,
		electronic and procedural safeguards. It is housed in a secure facility and Hostess restricts
		physical and network access to this facility to select trained staff and regularly evaluates its
		technologies, facilities, procedures and potential risks to maintain the security and privacy of our
		users&#146; data. As a rule, Hostess employees do not monitor or view your personal information or
		content stored in the Hostess service, but it may be viewed if we learn that our Terms of Service
		may have been violated and confirmation is required, or we otherwise determine that we have an
		obligation to review it; and certain Hostess services support the use of standard SSL encryption
		to protect data transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions
		cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other security software failures. When
		you sign a document using the Hostess app, the signature is stored locally on your device. When
		you send the document to our service via email, the document is stored on Hostess servers and
		pulled from the Hostess cloud when the signature is being attached to the document. The
		original document and the signed document are deleted from Hostess servers once they are sent
		back to you via email. Your signature is never stored permanently in our cloud. The files stored
		on your Hostess are accessible only to you via your Username and password. When you email
		the document to Hostess from iPhone or your computer, it is emailed directly from your iPhone
		or computer&#146;s built in email client. When the document is inside your email client, it is no
		longer under our protection and could become at risk of being viewed by others.
		<br />
		<br />
		When you delete a document from the Hostess cloud, it is removed from our system. A backup
		copy of that document might exist in one of our backup archives until it is purged by a newer
		backup. Our current backup rotation purges documents after 31 days.
		<br />
		<br />
		If Hostess learns of a security system breach we may attempt to notify you and provide
		information on protective steps, if available, by posting a notice on our web Application.
		Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing. To
		request written notice of any security breach in writing, please send an e-mail with your request
		and mailing address to <a class="arialUln16pt8CA671" href='mailto:info@myhostessapp.com'>info@myhostessapp.com</a> or via postal mail to the address in the Contact
		Us section below
